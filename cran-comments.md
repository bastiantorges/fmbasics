I get the following WARNING when running `devtools::release()`:

> * checking top-level files ... WARNING
> Conversion of â€˜README.mdâ€™ failed:
> pandoc: Failed to retrieve https://travis-ci.org/imanuelcostigan/fmbasics.svg?branch=master
> TlsException (HandshakeFailed (Error_Misc "user error (unexpected type received. expecting 
> handshake and got: Alert [(AlertLevel_Fatal,InternalError)])"))


I think this error is spurious. I can successfully access the URL in my browser and it renders correctly in the README on Github (https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/fmbasics/blob/master/README.md) and on CRAN (https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fmbasics/README.html).

I get a NOTE about misspelling ISDA which is an abbreviation that is expanded in the DESCRIPTION file. I don't think this is an issue.
